TAKING EDUCATION OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL 3 credits. Education is often considered only to take place in formal schooling environments with professionally-trained teachers and students sitting in classrooms. However, research shows - and our intuitions suggest - that education occurs every day in a variety of ways, with a variety of people, and in a variety of spaces. For example, education - or more specifically, teaching and learning - happens in spaces such as museums and libraries but also, perhaps, at sports practice and around the family dinner table. Truly understanding what it means to teach and learn involves delving into and unpacking this variety. Further, if creating change in whether and how different people have opportunities to teach and learn in our society requires exposing and exploiting this variety.

Starts with a simple proposition that 19th century modern school curriculum is concerned with making kinds of people: "the citizen", "a worker", "civic minded", "life-long learner", "motivated", "with grit", etc. Discussions explore "the building (and disseminating) of knowledge" in schools (curriculum) across nations, cultures, and within political and religious modes of thought, to understand how differences in the self and others are produced through schooling. Internationalizing education means understanding how curriculum, pedagogy, theories of learning, and notions of childhood from schooling generate "ways of thinking" about "kinds of people". Internationalizing the field of curriculum and instruction shows how difference is produced and categorized. Facilitates thinking about how regional and national representations of people go unexamined in school curriculums when studying "others".

INDIGENOUS FOODWAYS: FOOD AND SEED SOVEREIGNTY 2 credits. Indigenous foods of North America are a vital component of modern agricultural and food systems. Indigenous foods and foodways will be examined from interdisciplinary historical, legal, biological, and social perspectives. Historic indigenous foodways of the present-day upper Midwestern United States and the impact on food and seed sovereignty of settler colonialism and subsequent agricultural practices and policies will be explored. Current efforts to re-claim agricultural traditions and foodways to improve public health, economic opportunity, and food and seed sovereignty will be covered, including the right to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, to define one's own food and agriculture systems, and to control the mechanisms and policies that govern food distribution. Hands-on activities are featured; previous examples include cooking with indigenous foods, ice fishing, and tapping maple trees for syrup.

This course explores the art and science of purposeful living by integrating academic knowledge with issues real and relevant to students' lives including: identity and belonging; happiness, purpose and meaning; self- awareness and self-presentation; romantic, peer and family relationships; material culture, consumer behavior and financial well-being; and connections to community, culture, and society. From the microbes that inhabit our guts to political revolutions sparked by a tweet, human lives are embedded in an ecology of complex, interdependent systems. Using the lens of Human Ecology, you will address "big questions" like: How am I connected to others and to larger systems? What brings happiness and works for the "greater good" in human lives? An overarching goal of the course is to help you understand yourself as embedded in the web of ever-evolving interconnected networks, an "EcoYou." Human Ecology is a systems approach to studying and understanding relationships between humans and their everyday environments; it is a civic and socially conscious orientation that is committed to understanding and improving the quality of human lives. Human Ecology is inherently interdisciplinary drawing on research, theories and methods from diverse fields such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, public health, biology, and art and design.

BASIC SLEEP MECHANISMS AND SLEEP DISORDERS: FROM NEUROBIOLOGY TO SLEEP MEDICINE 3 credits. Sleep occupies a third of our life, is found in all animal species carefully studied so far, and loss of sleep has both acute and long- term negative consequences on the brain and the body. Still, why we sleep remains unclear, and hypotheses on the role of sleep for synaptic homeostasis, learning and memory are being tested. Focuses on the neurobiology of sleep, with detailed review of the brain structures involved in controlling wake and sleep, as well as the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep. Other topics include changes in sleep need with age, animal models to study sleep, sleep disorders, and genetics of sleep.

THE POLITICS OF PERSUASION: SOFT POWER IN EUROPE AND THE U.S. 1-3 credits. How powerful is non-military power? What are its vectors and its limits? International relations theorists have defined soft power as "the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion." This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was "soft power" implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter- insurgency. In the process of analyzing our case studies, we will refine our analytical vocabulary. Drawing on recent work in international relations, political theory, and international history, we will probe the meaning and utility of concepts like normative power, hegemony, cultural capital, and public diplomacy.

How powerful is non-military power? What are its vectors and its limits? International relations theorists have defined soft power as "the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion." This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was "soft power" implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter- insurgency. In the process of analyzing our case studies, we will refine our analytical vocabulary. Drawing on recent work in international relations, political theory, and international history, we will probe the meaning and utility of concepts like normative power, hegemony, cultural capital, and public diplomacy.
